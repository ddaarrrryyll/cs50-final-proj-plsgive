Application Name: PlsGive

This is a simple web application I made for CS50's final project to counter the high stress levels in my society.
Users are first greeted by the homepage which tells them the 'About' of this application together with the number of submitted content by other users.
Users can then navigate to other tabs namely "quotes, videos, cats, dogs, other animals" to their choice.
In each tab, a random content is chosen from the database of categorised content.
Users can report the currently shown content by clicking the 'Report' button which instantly removes the content from the database and moves it to another database for vetting
Users can also submit their own content to contribute to the database
Each submission will update the counter in each tab as well as the homepage
Error Checking includes:
