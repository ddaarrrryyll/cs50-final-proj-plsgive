**youtube embed doesn't work but should work when new links are provided üòî**


This is a simple web application I made for CS50's final project to counter the high stress levels in my society.
Users are first greeted by the homepage which tells them the 'About' of this application together with the number of submitted content by other users.
Users can then navigate to other tabs namely "quotes, videos, cats, dogs, other animals" to their choice.
In each tab, a random content is chosen from the database of categorised content.
Users can report the currently shown content by clicking the 'Report' button which instantly removes the content from the database and moves it to another database for vetting
Users can also submit their own content to contribute to the database
Each submission will update the counter in each tab as well as the homepage
Error Checking includes:
\n1)Empty input
\n2)Wrong link
\n3)Wrong input format


## Personal Reflection (22/6/2021)
This is my first ever "large scale" project completed at the end of Harvard's ever famous CS50. Looking back at this project after 1.5 years, there are definitely things to improve on but I have decided it is best to leave it as it is because it gives me the chance to look back at how much I have grown ever since I became a Computer Science undergraduate. (If I remember correctly a little bit of code is missing, probably secret tokens or something along those lines which I manually edited out from the main code because I had no idea about gitignore... haha I guess it's something to show that I've been learning üòÅ)
