I live in a society where stress levels are one of the highest in the world, this leads to many cases of depression
especially amongsts youths whose whole life, up to their current age, are spent on studying.

This made me want to create a webpage that targets these people and help cheer them up/release some stress.
Users can choose to either receive a random cute animal (eg. cats/dogs/others), receive a motivational quote, or
receive a motivational video by simply clicking on what they want.

Users can also choose to upload their own quotes/images so that the pool of images can be increased.

Whatever gets recently submitted will be posted on a sidebar (like live feedback) where other users can report for inappropriate/irrelevant
images to remove them from the database
